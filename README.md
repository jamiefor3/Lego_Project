# Overview
Welcome to my analysis of Lego sets from the year 1970-2022. This was a mini project I wanted to do as a refresher for some of the python skills I had learned. Like most kids I enjoyed playing with lego, which is what made this data set stand out to me and began this project. The main aims from this set were to identify trends throughout Lego's lifetime to see how it grew into the giant it is today. The data set includes 18,457 rows of unique lego products, with a wide range of themes spanning from sets based on movies, original Lego sets, and Lego books.

The data set I used can be found at [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground), it uses data sourced from [Brickset](https://brickset.com). I did do a small amount of cleaning and filtering before the data could be used for this python project. 

# The Questions
Below are some of the questions I wanted to answer in this mini project:

1. How many Lego sets have been released since 1970?
2. What is the relation between the amount of Lego pieces in a set and the price of the set?
3. What theme of lego sets were released the most throughout the different decades?

# Tools I Used
- **Python:** The backbone of the analysis allowing me to find key insights through the use of scripts. Within python I frequently used the following libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool used to run my python scripts, allowing easy inclusion of notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Also used for executing python scrips
- **Git and Github:** Used for version control and sharing my project.
